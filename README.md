## Understanding Spring MVC with C.R.U.D. applications


### Project Overview
    
    Use Spring MVC to create a unique C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. 
    
    My application functions as a video game weapon inventory. The user is able to view 
    the existing weapons in their inventory, create new weapons, or remove weapons they
    no longer want. They may also modify their weapons by either "Infusing" them 
    (changing the damage type of the weapon) or by "Reinforcing" them (increasing the 
    weapons base damage). Upon Reinforcing a weapon, the weapon's name will appear 
    with a "Reinforced" lable preceeding the original name. The user may also filter 
    through their inventory by "Weapon Classes" (swords, spears, bows, and the like).
    
### Goals Moving Forward

    I would very much like to go more in depth with this project. Ideally, I would 
    like the user to be able to click on each weapon and be shown detailed 
    information about the weapon in question (including pictures and details not shown in 
    the original inventory list). At present, I am unsure how to go about this without having 
    numerous JSP's dedicated to each weapon individually. Additionally, I am unsure as to 
    how I would include user-generated weapons in this process.
    
### Stumbling Blocks

    Although my program functions well enough, there is a fair amount of repetition 
    in my code. I would like to condense what I have into something more managable. 
    I feel this will also allow me to explore the additional functionality
    I mentioned in the previous section.
